# Fashion MNIST Classification with Convolutional Neural Network

## Introduction

This project focuses on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, with each image being 28x28 pixels. Our goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the category of a given fashion item.

## Prerequisites

Before executing the code, ensure the following software and libraries are installed on your local machine:

- Python 3
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

If you do not have these components, please install them before proceeding to the execution steps.

## Installation

1. **Install Python 3:** Download the latest version of Python 3 from the official Python website (https://www.python.org) based on your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Install Jupyter Notebook:** Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command: `pip install jupyter`.

3. **Install Required Libraries:** Execute the following command to install necessary libraries: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow`.

## Data File

The Fashion MNIST dataset is available directly in TensorFlow. You can load it using the following commands:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
fashion_mnist = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = fashion_mnist.load_data()

```
## Execution

To execute the project, follow the steps below:

1. **Download the project files:** Clone or download the repository containing the Jupyter Notebook file (Fashion_MNIST_CNN.ipynb) and any other necessary files.

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:** Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing the project files. Run the command jupyter notebook to open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser.

3. **Access the project notebook:** In the Jupyter interface, navigate to and open the Fashion_MNIST_CNN.ipynb file.

4. **Execute the code:** Follow the instructions provided in the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code step by step.

## Results

The results of the CNN model will be displayed within the Jupyter Notebook. You will see the model's performance metrics, such as accuracy and loss over the training period, as well as visualizations of the classification results.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of using convolutional neural networks to classify images. By working through the provided Jupyter Notebook, you will gain an understanding of the steps involved in data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction with CNNs on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
